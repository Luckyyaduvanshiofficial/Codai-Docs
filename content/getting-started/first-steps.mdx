## üíª Exercise 1: Code Generation

Let's generate actual code. We'll start simple and progressively get more complex.

### Beginner: Simple Function

<Steps>

### Write the Prompt

```text
Write a Python function that checks if a number is even or odd
```

### Expected Output

```python
def is_even_or_odd(number):
    """
    Check if a number is even or odd.
    
    Args:
        number (int): The number to check
        
    Returns:
        str: 'even' if the number is even, 'odd' if it's odd
    """
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return "even"
    else:
        return "odd"

# Example usage
print(is_even_or_odd(4))   # Output: even
print(is_even_or_odd(7))   # Output: odd
```

### Test the Code

1. Copy the generated code
2. Paste into your Python environment
3. Run it and verify it works

</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Notice** how the AI includes documentation, examples, and proper formatting automatically!
</Callout>

### Intermediate: More Complex Function

Now let's try something with multiple requirements:

<Steps>

### Write a Detailed Prompt

```text
Create a Python function that:
1. Takes a list of numbers
2. Removes duplicates
3. Sorts in descending order
4. Returns the top 3 highest unique numbers
5. Handles edge cases (empty list, less than 3 items)
```

### Expected Output

```python
def get_top_three_unique(numbers):
    """
    Get the top 3 highest unique numbers from a list.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): List of numbers (can contain duplicates)
        
    Returns:
        list: Top 3 unique numbers in descending order
              (or fewer if list has less than 3 unique items)
    """
    # Handle empty list
    if not numbers:
        return []
    
    # Remove duplicates and sort in descending order
    unique_sorted = sorted(set(numbers), reverse=True)
    
    # Return top 3 (or all if less than 3)
    return unique_sorted[:3]

# Test cases
print(get_top_three_unique([1, 5, 2, 8, 2, 9, 5]))  # [9, 8, 5]
print(get_top_three_unique([10, 20]))               # [20, 10]
print(get_top_three_unique([]))                     # []
print(get_top_three_unique([7, 7, 7]))              # [7]
```

### Analyze the Response

Notice how the AI:
- ‚úÖ Handled all 5 requirements
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ Included multiple test cases
- ‚úÖ Used efficient Python syntax (`set()`, `sorted()`)
- ‚úÖ Explained the logic with comments

</Steps>

---

### Advanced: Complete Program

Let's create a more substantial piece of code:

```text
Write a Python program that:
- Reads a CSV file containing student names and scores
- Calculates the average score
- Identifies students above and below average
- Generates a summary report
- Handles file not found errors
- Uses proper error handling throughout
```

<Callout type="info">
  The AI will generate a complete, production-ready program with imports, error handling, and documentation. This showcases CodaiPro's ability to handle complex requirements.
</Callout>

---

## üêõ Exercise 2: Debugging Code

CodaiPro excels at finding and fixing bugs. Let's practice!

<Steps>

### Present Buggy Code

Ask CodaiPro:

```text
Find and fix the bugs in this Python code:

def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)

scores = [85, 92, 78, 90]
average = calculate_average(scores)
print(f"Average: {average}")

# What happens with an empty list?
empty_scores = []
empty_average = calculate_average(empty_scores)
```

### Review the AI's Analysis

CodaiPro will identify:

**Bug #1: Division by Zero**
```python
# Problem: len(numbers) is 0 for empty list
# Fix: Check if list is empty before calculating

def calculate_average(numbers):
    if not numbers:  # Handle empty list
        return 0
    
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)
```

**Bug #2: Potential Type Errors**
```python
# Problem: Non-numeric values could cause issues
# Fix: Add type validation

def calculate_average(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    
    try:
        total = sum(numbers)
        return total / len(numbers)
    except TypeError:
        raise ValueError("All elements must be numeric")
```

### Apply the Fixes

The AI will provide the complete corrected version with explanations for each fix.

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important Learning:** Always test edge cases! Empty lists, null values, and unexpected input types are common sources of bugs.
</Callout>

## üìñ Exercise 3: Code Explanation

Understanding code is as important as writing it. Let's learn how to use CodaiPro as a teaching tool.

<Steps>

### Request an Explanation

```text
Explain how this algorithm works step by step:

def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return -1
```

### Study the Explanation

CodaiPro will provide:

1. **Algorithm Overview**
   - What binary search is
   - When to use it
   - Why it's efficient

2. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**
   - How the `left` and `right` pointers work
   - Why we calculate `mid`
   - How the search space narrows

3. **Time Complexity Analysis**
   - O(log n) time complexity
   - Why it's faster than linear search

4. **Visual Example**
   - Walking through a specific search
   - Showing how variables change

### Ask Follow-up Questions

```text
What's the time complexity compared to linear search?
```

```text
Can I use binary search on an unsorted list?
```

```text
How would I modify this to find the last occurrence of the target?
```

</Steps>

| **300-800** | Standard functions | "Write a function to parse JSON" |
| **800-1500** | Detailed explanations | "Explain object-oriented programming" |
| **1500-2000** | Complete programs | "Create a todo list application" |

### Experiment Time

<Steps>

### Try Different Settings

1. Set Temperature to **0.3**, Max Length to **500**
2. Ask: `"Write a sorting algorithm"`
3. Note the response

4. Change Temperature to **0.8**, Max Length to **1500**
5. Ask the same question
6. Compare the responses

### Observe the Differences

- **Lower temperature:** More focused, conventional solution (probably quicksort or mergesort)
- **Higher temperature:** Might suggest multiple algorithms, creative optimizations, or unusual approaches

</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
