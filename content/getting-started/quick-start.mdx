## 💬 Your First AI Interaction

Let's generate your first piece of code with AI assistance!

<Steps>

### Ask a Simple Question

In the input box at the bottom, type:

```text
Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number
```

Then press **Enter** or click **Send**.

### Watch the AI Respond

Within seconds, you'll see the AI generating a response like:

```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a number.
    
    Args:
        n (int): A non-negative integer
    
    Returns:
        int: The factorial of n
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result

# Example usage
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

### Copy and Use the Code

Click anywhere in the code block and press **Ctrl+C** to copy, then paste it into your IDE!

</Steps>

<Callout type="success">
  **Congratulations!** You've just used AI to generate your first piece of code with CodaiPro!
</Callout>

## ⚙️ Customize Your Experience

Now let's explore the settings to get better results for your specific needs.

### Understanding the Settings Panel

Located on the right side of the interface:

#### 🌡️ Temperature (0.1 - 1.0)

Controls the creativity vs. accuracy of responses:

- **0.1 - 0.3:** Very precise, deterministic (best for debugging)
- **0.4 - 0.6:** Balanced (recommended for most tasks)
- **0.7 - 1.0:** Creative, varied solutions (best for brainstorming)

<Callout type="tip">
  **Recommendation:** Start with **0.5** for a good balance between accuracy and creativity.
</Callout>

#### 📏 Max Length (100 - 2000 tokens)

Controls how long the AI's responses will be:

- **100 - 500:** Brief answers, quick responses
- **500 - 1000:** Standard explanations (recommended)
- **1000 - 2000:** Detailed, comprehensive answers

<Callout type="info">
  One token ≈ 4 characters. A 500-token response is roughly 2000 characters or ~300 words.
</Callout>

#### 🎭 System Instructions

Custom instructions to shape AI behavior. Examples:

```text
You are a helpful coding tutor. Explain concepts clearly for beginners.
```

```text
Provide production-ready code with error handling and documentation.
```

```text
Focus on performance optimization and best practices.
```

## 🎯 Try Different Scenarios

Now that you're set up, try these common use cases:

<Tabs items={['Code Generation', 'Debugging', 'Explanation', 'Optimization']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Generate Code from Description**
    
    ```text
    Create a JavaScript function that validates email addresses using regex
    ```
    
    The AI will provide a complete, working function with validation logic.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Debug Existing Code**
    
    ```text
    Find the bug in this code:
    
    def calculate_average(numbers):
        total = 0
        for num in numbers:
            total += num
        return total / len(numbers)
    ```
    
    The AI will identify issues (e.g., division by zero) and suggest fixes.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Understand Complex Code**
    
    ```text
    Explain how this quicksort algorithm works step by step:
    
    [paste your code here]
    ```
    
    Get a detailed breakdown of the algorithm's logic and flow.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Improve Code Performance**

## 🎓 Best Practices for Great Results

### ✅ DO:

1. **Be Specific About Language**
   ```text
   ✅ "Write a Python function..."
   ❌ "Write a function..."
   ```

2. **Provide Context**
   ```text
   ✅ "Create a REST API endpoint in Express.js that handles user registration with email validation"
   ❌ "Make an API endpoint"
   ```

3. **Ask Follow-up Questions**
   ```text
   "Can you add error handling to the previous function?"
   "Explain the time complexity of this algorithm"
   ```

4. **Specify Requirements**
   ```text
   "Include comments, error handling, and type hints"
   "Make it compatible with Python 3.8+"
   ```

### ❌ DON'T:

1. **Don't Be Vague**
   - Bad: "Help me with my code"
   - Good: "Debug this Python function that's returning incorrect values"

2. **Don't Skip Language Specification**
   - Bad: "Write a sorting function"
   - Good: "Write a merge sort function in Java"

3. **Don't Paste Huge Code Blocks**
   - Instead, ask about specific parts or functions

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Issue: Slow Responses

**Solution:** Reduce Max Length to 500-800 tokens and close other applications.

### Issue: Application Won't Start

**Solution:** 
1. Check if another instance is running (Task Manager)
2. Run `KILL_V21.bat` from the CodaiPro folder
3. Try again

### Issue: "Port 8000 in use" Error

**Solution:**
```powershell
# In PowerShell
Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8000).OwningProcess | Stop-Process -Force
```
